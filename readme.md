# Madison

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/DCgov/dc-madison.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DCgov/dc-madison)

Madison is the open-source, collaborative document editing platform that powers [drafts.dc.gov](https://drafts.dc.gov).

The site is in beta, so if you run into any problems or have questions, please open an issue and we will try to respond as soon as possible. 

We have forked the [Madison master repository](https://github.com/opengovfoundation/madison), which remains in active development. You are encouraged to submit (non-DC specific) [issues](https://github.com/opengovfoundation/madison/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/opengovfoundation/madison/compare?expand=1) there instead.

## Installation

Please take a look at the [Madison Documentation](https://github.com/opengovfoundation/madison/tree/master/docs) for how to install Madison.
